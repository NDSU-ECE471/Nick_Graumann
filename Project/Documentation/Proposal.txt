For my ECE 471 project, I am interested in making a basic oscilloscope. The scope would likely feature 2 channels, each with a dedicated external ADC chip.

For the ADC, I would use an external ADC chip for the SPI/I2C communication requirement as well as for performance reasons. One I had in mind is the ADCS7476AIMF from TI, which is a 12-bit SPI ADC which can sample at 1MSPS (much better than the onboard 200KSPS of the 1769).

The output would be displayed on the screen, with user input coming in from the buttons on the dev board. I envision single as well as normal or auto trigger modes, selectable timebase and volts/div, and some simple math functions such as add or subtract. Additionally, I would add some measurement functions like measurement of peak voltage, frequency, etc.
