== MouseDevice example       ==
==                           ==
===============================
This example implements a HID class device with mouse report descriptors. 
Mouse movement reports are sent to the host by the device when buttons or 
the joystick is pressed on the development board.

On the Embedded Artists LPCXpresso Rev A or B Baseboard this example will 
move the host PC's mouse cursor when the joystick is operated. Pressing the
joystick down will create a mouse left click.

This example can be built and debugged using two compiler tool chains.
Visit http://www.lpcware.com/content/project/LPCUSBlib/build-it to learn
how to setup and configure these tool chains to build this example.

===================================

This example depends on the joystick and buttons present on the EA Baseboard to work
but can be retargeted to other development boards by modifying the joystick and button
functions to other inputs that are present on your board.

The software that makes up this example is designed to run on many different
development boards. Therefore the compiler must be configured to build an image
that is targeted to the development board you are using. This section explains
how to set these build configurations for each of the supported compilers.

1. LPCXpresso LPC1769 stand-alone. Solder a type-B USB receptacle onto the board
   and wire it up. See included schematics for details. Connect the type-B end
   of a USB cable to the receptacle on the LPCXpresso board and the type-A end
   to the USB receptacle on a PC

2. LPCXpresso LPC1769 plugged into the LPCXpresso base board Rev B. Plug the 
   LPCXpresso LPC1769 board into the connector labeled J4 on a LPCXpresso base
   board Rev B. Configure the base board according to the users guide from 
   Embedded Artists. Connect the mini type-B end of a USB cable to the
   receptacle on the base board labeled X1 and the type-A end to the USB
   receptacle on a PC.
   
   Once the USB cable is connected to the board the following LEDs should be
   illuminated:
      LED25  (vbus)
      LED26  (3.3v rail)
		
   For both configurations the JTAG debugger is connected to the mini USB
   receptacle labeled J3 on the LPCXpresso LPC1769 board.
