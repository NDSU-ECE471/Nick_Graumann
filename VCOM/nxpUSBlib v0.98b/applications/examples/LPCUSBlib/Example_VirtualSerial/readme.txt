== VirtualSerialDevice example ==
==                             ==
=================================

This example implements a CDC/ACM (USB-to-COM) virtual serial device. The
example reads and writes data through a serial port on the chip which is
connected to either 9pin UART connector or a dedicated USB-to-COM chip
(FTDI) on the board.

This example can be built and debugged using two compiler tool chains.
Visit http://www.lpcware.com/content/project/LPCUSBlib/build-it to learn
how to setup and configure these tool chains to build this example.

===================================

The software that makes up this example is designed to run on many different
development boards. Therefore the compiler must be configured to build an image
that is targeted to the development board you are using. This section explains
how to set these build configurations for each of the supported compilers.

When the example is run and the board is connected to a PC with a USB cable a new
device called "Communication Port" will show up in the device manager under the
section "Ports (COM & LPT)"

Open a terminal emulation program and connected it to the COM port shown next to
this entry in the device manager. Open a second terminal emulation program connected
to the other UART connector (9 pin UART or USB-to-COM bridge) on the board. Type
characters in each terminal window and see them print on the other terminal window.
